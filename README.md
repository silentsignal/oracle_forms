Oracle Forms Test Scripts
=========================

Tools to test Oracle Forms based applications.

OracleFormsTester
-----------------

The `OracleFormsTester/` directory contains a Burp Suite extension that performs decryption, Message parsing and Scanner insertion point selection (Eclipse project).

To use these programs include `frmall.jar` archive provided by Oracle Forms  in your classpath. New Burp versions seem to have changed how Java libraries are being loaded (see #9). The folder with the fmrall.jar must be added to the JAVA Environment in the BurpSuite Extender Options. 

The following files outside the extension directory are simple utility programs that can help further develop the extension:

* MessageTester.java - Message parsers that allows easy debugging of the deserialization process.
* OracleFormsBruteForce.java - Primitive brute-forcer for encrypted protocol messages.
* OracleFormsSyncingBruteForce.java - Primitive brute-forcer that demonstrates the attack against an out-of-sync cipher stream. 

Further information can be found in my [GWAPT Gold Paper: Automated Security Testing of Oracle Forms Applications](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/testing/automated-security-testing-oracle-forms-applications-35970).

OracleFormsSerializer
---------------------

**You probably want to use this**

This is a new implementation that moves encryption state away from the client and Burp. Instead of juggling with state saving and restore for every possible message we simply kill encryption from the client (so Burp can work with plaintext messages) and reimplement it in a [mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy) script.

Eliminating cryptography from the client is done by corrupting the handshake (huge thanks to [neonbunny](https://twitter.com/%40neonbunny9) for figuring this out!). The mitmproxy script takes care of the handshake and provides appropriately encrypted byte stream to the Oracle Forms server.

(Originally the tools worked with a patched version of the `frmall.jar` client library. If for any reason the current method stops working, the original approach can be followed as described [here](JARPATCH.md).)

Start mitmproxy with the provided script:
```
mitmdump -s mitmproxy_oracleforms.py -p 8081 
```

Configure Burp to use the upstream proxy 127.0.0.1:8081 and load the OracleFormsSerializer extension! New Burp versions seem to have changed how Java libraries are being loaded (see #9). The folder with the fmrall.jar must be added to the JAVA Environment in the BurpSuite Extender Options. 

Now you can start your Oracle Forms application, configured to use Burp as its proxy. The mitmproxy script will corrupt the handshake, so the client won't encrypt its messages. The OracleFormSerializer extension will then do message serialization for you. Messages will be translated to standard HTTP GET requests in the OracleForms request editor tab with String parameters provided in a query string in the Message body. If you edit these parameters the extension will automatically update the original binary Forms message appropriately (e.g. in Repeater). The extension will also register new insertion points for the Scanner so you can use that too (keep in mind that insertion points provided by Burp will probably break stuff though!).

### Building the Extension

Download the `frmall.jar` archive from your target and copy it under `OracleFormsSerializer/lib`. Inside `OracleFormsSerializer/` start an Gradle build:

```
$ ./gradlew shadowJar
```

You should find `OracleFormsSerializer-<SOMEVERSION>-all.jar` under `build/libs/`.

### Message Editing

The extension implements partial (de)serialization of Oracle Forms Message streams, making the messages human partially readable and editable on the Oracle Forms message viewer tab provided by the Burp extension. 

A Message stream is an ordered list of Message objects, and Message objects objects consist of an ordered list of Properties. This means that we can associate the human readable representation of messages with Oracle's true form by keeping track of Messages and Properties by their positions either in the Message stream or inside a Message.

Supported operations:
* Editing property values of the following types:
  * Strings
  * Integers
  * Booleans

Definitely *not* supported (yet):
* Insert/delete/reorder Messages or Properties
* Setting a Property to a different type
* Setting a Property to `null`
* Editing nested Messages
* If a Message stream is split across multiple HTTP messages, we can't reconstruct a modified stream. In such cases editing is not supported, and editing is disabled on the Oracle Forms tab. 
* Editing Delta Messages


### Options

#### Response timeout

The mitmproxy script now handles "wait" error codes ([ifError:11](https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-893120)) that instruct the client to wait before it can retrieve the results from the server. The maximum wait time can be configured in the command line (value given in milliseconds):

```
mitmdump -s mitmproxy_oracleforms.py --set max_wait=10000 -p 8081 # Wait at most 10s
```

By default the wait time is unlimited. After a limit is reached the error codes are passed back to the client that should handle them appropriately. Handling these errors in the proxy allows downstream scripts to make detections based on the RTT of a single request instead of parsing multiple messages.

#### Handshake corruption

See [JARPATCH.md](JARPATCH.md)

### mitmproxy support

The script was upgraded to support mitmproxy 4 (tested with 4.0.3), should also work with version 3.

Scanner Configuration
---------------------

An exported Burp 2.x Scanner configuration is added to the repo. Main properties:
* Limited to relevant tests
* Virtually unlimited error thresholds (see #15)
* Limited insertion points

*Important:* In order to keep the stream ciphers in sync, you have to configure a single threaded resource pool for your scan!

It is very likely that automated input will render the UI unusable and you have to restart the application! Use [Logger++](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/470b7057b86f41c396a97903377f3d81) to keep track of responses and any server-side errors (or interesting behavior)!

Common Errors
-------------

* FRM-92095: Older versions of Oracle Forms won't start until you convince it that Java is still owned by Sun Microsystems... Create a system wide environment variable (as described [here](https://blogs.oracle.com/ptian/solution-for-error-frm-92095:-oracle-jnitiator-version-too-low)): `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS='-Djava.vendor="Sun Microsystems Inc."'`
* FRM-92101: `frmall.jar` is cached by the browser so if serve a patched version and then remove the mitmproxy script for some reason (e.g. live demo at a conference...) the browser will then send an `If-Modified-Since` header to the original server so it won't serve the new (unpatched) JAR. As a result the server-side decryption won't work. You can resolve this by removing the mentioned header from the HTTP request (Burp Proxy has a built-in replace rule to do this). The cause can be of course any other problem resulting in invalid streams being decrypted by the server. 
* `ifError: 11/xxx` on server responses: These messages [instruct the client](https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-893120) to wait xxx milliseconds and try to retrieve the request by sending an empty request again. This should be properly handled by the mitmproxy script now.

Pro Tips
--------

* If something goes wrong you'll probably want to restart mitmproxy so the objects will be reinitialized to a clean state
* Scan only with a single thread
* Disable default Scanner insertion points
